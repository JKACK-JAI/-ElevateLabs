# Cyber Security Internship - Task 1

## Task Title:
Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

## Objective:
To discover open ports on devices in the local network using `Nmap` and analyze their exposure.

## Tools Used:

- Nmap (TCP SYN scan)

## üíª Command Used:

sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24



# Cyber Security Internship - Task 2

 **Analyze a Phishing Email Sampl**

 # Objective:
Simulate a real-world phishing attack using social engineering techniques to understand how attackers craft and deliver fake emails, host phishing pages, and collect sensitive user data ‚Äî purely for ethical and educational purposes.

üõ†Ô∏è What i Did in This Task:
# Created a Netflix-Themed Phishing Email
Designed a realistic HTML email mimicking a Netflix account suspension alert.

Included official branding such as the Netflix logo, color palette, and formatting.

Added a ‚ÄúVerify Account‚Äù button with a hover URL masked as:

https://www.netflix.com/account/verify

# Tools Used:

-Inline CSS for email compatibility

-Gmail HTML injection using Inspect Element

-Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) for testing email delivery

# Hosted a Phishing Page
Cloned Netflix‚Äôs login UI using HTML/CSS

Hosted the fake page locally using:

-python3 -m http.server 8000
-Publicly exposed it via:

--cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000-- 

# Outcome:
Victims visiting the phishing link were presented with a fully functional, fake Netflix login interface.

# Generated Phishing Link Using MIP22 Tool
Used the MIP22 tool to cloak the raw Cloudflare link with a cleaner, more deceptive domain:

**http://collar-comparable-patrick-astrology.trycloudflare.com**

This enhanced believability and helped avoid detection by spam filters or URL previews.

# Advantage:
MIP22 generated a custom subdomain to make the phishing link look safe and legitimate.

# Captured Victim Credentials
Inputs from the phishing form (email/phone and password) were collected via a backend script.

Optional fingerprinting could capture:

Victim IP address

Device type

Browser

Date/time

# Logged To:

data.txt ‚Äî for credentials

fingerprint.txt ‚Äî for metadata
